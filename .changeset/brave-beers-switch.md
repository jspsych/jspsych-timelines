Add separate fixation_duration and isi_duration parameters. The trial sequence is now fixation → stimulus → ISI blank. The old isi_timeout parameter has been replaced with fixation_duration (duration of fixation cross before stimulus) and isi_duration (duration of blank screen after stimulus response).
