FEAT: Initial release of @jspsych-timelines/list-sorting-working-memory

This is the first public release of the package, which is an experiment timeline that implements the List Sorting Working Memory Task following the [NIH Toolbox's technical manual](https://nihtoolbox.org/test/test/). It is complete, documented and follows the structure defined in [@jspsych-dev/new-timeline](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-dev/tree/main/packages/new-timeline).

NOTE: A full suite of unit tests is still pending and will be added in a future release.
