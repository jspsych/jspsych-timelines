We are helping build packages for a new jspsych repository: jsPsychTimelines. This uses existing plugins and jspsych conventions to create a fully parameterizable, customizable, and general experiment. Researchers can import a timeline and change a few parameters to produce a fully-fledged experiment with the way they desire it. We generally do not create or mess with HTML in timelines (following jspsych conventions), unlike in plugins. We are not creating the HTML page, we are more using existing plugins with HTML to combine multiple pages and plugins to make a full experiment. If and when creating randomization logic, try to use jspsych features such as jspsych shuffle or jspsych randomization. If unfamiliar, look them up online. Timelines must have createInstructions, createPractice, and createTimeline functions. createInstructions: is the exact same in every timeline, no variation needed unless specially requested. This function must take at least an array of HTML_STRING (write this in docs) to produce the pages, and then another text object (trial_text), which will be used for the next and prev buttons texts. The texts array and object should be imported from a separate text.ts file in src. do not create text variation for data and timeline units and things only the developer/researcher can see. The text file is supposed to be for things that the participant would see, that way we can translate that and use the timeline across regions. researchers and developers can speak english, so lets hardcode those things. Speaking of data, we should have two data for everything: task and phase, and page if applicable.  createTimeline: takes jsPsych and then an object with the actual parameters for everything and creates the whole experiment from instructions to finish. This is the config. The config should have default parameters for almost everything to where the experiment should not fail by default (unless the researcher really must decide something for an experiment to make sense, you can leave that parameter as undefined then). All these parameters should also be included in the calls in the html file, even if commented out mostly, just so that users can immediately see all usable parameters in HTML file and uncomment unnecessary or less commonly used ones. createTimeline can have helper functions if needed to create specific parts of the timeline such as createTimelineVariables or createPractice to create practice trials etc... createPractice: can be a function that just calls createTimeline with different defaults or if extra text is needed or something can be some sort of replica. Also, usually when we prompt you to make a timeline, you will clutter the timeline with unnecessary features such as an end screen thanking them or giving them data or whatever. You can make things like that but add them at the very end then export them as utils. Oh also export actual timeline units as timelineUnits, and do not define any functions or anything inside the exporting itself. Additionally, functions should all be camelCase and parameters should be snake_case, anything else can be whatever you think is most appropriate. Parameters every timeline should have (or a variation of)       /* general */
      show_instructions: false,
      show_practice: false,
      num_blocks: 3,
      num_trials: 50,
      trial_timeout: 500,
      isi_timeout: 500,
      probability: 0.75,

You may edit any existing files, but ask before creating new files in the package (dont ask for text.ts, just create that one).
Now, for a good example of a timeline, you can go to the other packages and explore them. Especially go-nogo. Explore that well and the documentation of it, we like the format of the documentation there. You do not need to replicate every function that is there as different timelines have different needs. Only three core functions really: createInstructions, createTimeline, and createPractice. And createPractice can just call createTimeline with different defaults if thats sufficient.

Additionally, you will need to go through all the files and fill out some things such as dependencies and documentation and create sufficient testing. Dont create a thousand tests, a few good ones will suffice. For docs, dont delete or add too many sections, check out go-nogo and make something similar.

If needed, reread this or any file whenever, do not worry about token consumption or efficiency. We want the best workable jspsychy results.

Now, the timeline we are creating is for the columbia card task. There is a plugin that you should explore in node_modules\@jspsych-contrib and understand very well. Some of the parameters of the plugin might be repeated as parameters of createTimeline. Make this a workable timeline that experimenters can use to create full experiments with enough customizability to be used across different research. Bonus points if you can look up differences across research and papers for columbia card task and identify necessary parameters.
